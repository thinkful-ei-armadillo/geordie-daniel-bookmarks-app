# Geordie and Daniel's Bookmark App!

Our bookmarks app has come along well - we have successfully achieved: 
* Bookmark creation
    * Switches the main view from "add bookmark" and "minimum rating" button/selections to a form to input new bookmark details.
    * Includes title, url, description, and rating fields
    * Switches main view back on submit
* Default condensed view
* API GETs
* API POSTs
* API DELETEs
* Expand/detailed view
* Filtered view with minimum rating
* "Visit Site" button
* delete bookmark button
* Star ratings for each bookmark
* User-side feedback for error handling

Enjoy!
