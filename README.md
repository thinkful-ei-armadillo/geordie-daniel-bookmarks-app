# Geordie and Daniel's Bookmark App!

Our bookmarks app has come along well - we have achieved successful: 
* Bookmark creation
    * Switches the main view from "add bookmark" and "minimum rating" button/selections to a form to input new bookmark details.
    * Includes title, url, description, and rating fields
    * Switches main view back on submit
* Default condensed view
* API GETs
* API POSTs
* API DELETEs (in two forms, individual delete button and clear all bookmarks)
* ix issue with first JSON object printing twice
* Expand/detailed view
* Filtered view with minimum rating
* Get "Visit Site" button/link working
* Starring dynamically by reading current STORE.list.rating value and rendering appropriate number of stars accordingly.~~
* User-side feedback for error handling
* Beautify with CSS

Enjoy!
